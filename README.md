 for ponytown: iwc(Interact with care) majorly, c+h for friends please ^,^  

 i have major depression , sometimes i take it out on other people, i'am extremely sensitive aswell so bare with me, i don't know 
 if you're joking or not, so let me know if you are, so i don't take it seriously :") . (Im also dealing with gender dysphoria, and that 
 tends to make me feel unwell, and not in the mood)

 im also gonna try and be better, and not start random drama  





 More info about me!! (Important, please read!) ^^

i DO not support nazi supporters/supporters of h*tler,  i do not purposefully bring drama towards me, unless its serious, and i point it out if i have too, but, please DO not bring drama around me, it makes me feel unwell/stresses me out, to where i need to get up, and breathe, because i get light-headed/overwelmed, DO not bring up past drama either it makes me mad/pressed, because some of the drama that happend was stressful/horrible. I AM changing, and working on myself, and my mood around others in ponytown/online, you can interact with me if you want, and especially do not talk to me about my old friendships either  

I am also not friends with (Respectfully)sills, or sill's friends, nor dihlilah(For personal reasons). 
Please DO not assume something about me, its wrong, and hear me out before you jump at me with assumptions. 

and i AM trying not to friend/int with problematic people, i WILL check your profile if you meet my DNI critta. 

I block/hide FREELY if you make me uncomfortable/my friends uncomfortable.
